# Strato-Rocket
Strato Rocket, My first mid-power rocket to get into rocketry, I built this rocket as a base to start my journey of building rockets!
Strato stands at 1.1m tall
It reaches 560m in altitdude and has a top speed of mach 0.4
The flight is recorded on a LILYGO T-Beam which serves as the primary flight computers and GPS. It also uses a BMP390 sensor to measure altiude through the flight. The rocket features an ESP32-Cam connected to an OV2640 camera to record fligth video. The flight recovery system uses a 36in parachute depolyed using black powder and will all be held together through a shock cord.
