# Strato-Rocket
Strato Rocket, My first mid-power rocket to get into rocketry,
I built this rocket as a base to start my journey of building rockets! I'm very passionate about aeronautics and this my first project to help me understnad develope my knowledge.
Strato stands at 1.1m tall
It reaches 560m in altitdude and has a top speed of mach 0.4
The flight is recorded on a LILYGO T-Beam which serves as the primary flight computers and GPS. It also uses a BMP390 sensor to measure altiude through the flight. The rocket features an ESP32-Cam connected to an OV2640 camera to record fligth video. The flight recovery system uses a 36in parachute depolyed using black powder and will all be held together through a shock cord.
